# ASD - Attendance Register

# Project Description
  Software for the management of sports activities, trainers' and athletes' management. The application has two different roles: the administrator and the trainer. 
  The administrator can perform CRUD actions for both trainers and athletes. He can assign both to individual sports categories.
  Finally, the app allows the administrator to generate a PDF file with the list of monthly hours for each trainer and a PDF REPORT of the total number of hours, for all   trainers.
  The coach, on the other hand, accesses the calendar of his own categories and displays the list of assigned athletes. He can check for the presence of the athletes. 
  The trainer can enter the number of hours/minutes of training, with increments of 30 minutes. He can make changes to the dates every 7 days. The app allows the           trainer to generate a PDF file with the attendance list.
